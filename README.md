# Public library data maps

This project will initially map library fine regimes in public libraries across the Australian State of Victoria. In the long term I hope to expand it to all Australian States and Territories and include more data that can be combined and cross-referenced, e.g. library funding from local and state governments, HILDA data, median incomes of the community, PLV data etc.
