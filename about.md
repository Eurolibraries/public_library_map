## About Library Map

This project collects and maps data from public libraries across the Australia and the external Australian Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In the long term I hope to include more data that can be combined and cross-referenced, e.g. library funding from local and state governments, HILDA data etc.

You should be able to find the location of every public library in Australia territory, plus the standard loan period for each libary service, and whether they charge overdue fines (if known, in both cases).

Soon you will be able to see which integrated library system (ILS/LMS) each library service uses.

### Why this data?

When I worked as a systems librarian in public libraries I often wondered how the social networks of decision makers - most obviously reflected by geography and state borders - affected decision making on things like library sofware procurement. I thought mapping systems visually might reveal things that are less obvious on a simple table or list.

Rules about loan periods are arbitrary. I thought it might be interesting to see whether there are any regional trends.

Fines for overdue library books are inefficient, ineffective, perverse, and regressive. "Punishable by fine" simply means "legal for rich people". Mapping library fine regimes provides a view of any regional patterns, and also allows activists to target libraries that still charge overdue fines.

### Definitions

#### Overdue fines

A library service is classified as charging fines for overdue items if any kind of non-refundable fee is charged prior to **28 days overdue**. This period has been chosen because some libraries declare an item "lost" around that time, and invoice the borrower for a *replacement fee*. Designating these libraries as "not charging overdue fines" and others that charge e.g. a "notice fee" at the same cutoff time as "charging overdue fines" starts to get a bit weird.

#### Standard loan period

The "standard loan period" is the loan period applied to an ordinary book, and may apply to other items or indeed all items held in a library. Data for Western Australia is provisional and in some cases has been rounded to the nearest "week" (e.g. a 19 day loan period is recorded as 3 weeks).

#### Indigenous Knowledge Centre

Currently, only libraries classified as *Indigenous Knowledge Centres* by the State Library of Queensland are classified as such on this map. In future there may be other centres so identified.

### Caveats

Most of the data for the map comes from government open data sources. As such it is subject to government bias, and may be out of date or over/under sampled.

### Nomenclature

Library locations are classified into four types. In general mode these are:

* Settler Knowledge Centres
* Indigenous Knowledge Centres
* Worker Pacification Centres
* Imperial Knowledge Centres

If this naming convention makes you uncomfortable, you may view the map in *White fragility mode*, in which case the names are:

* Public Libraries
* Indigenous Knowledge Centres
* Mechanics Institutes
* National & State Libraries

I will explain a little more about why this is the case, in my talk at the GO GLAM miniconf at linuxconf.au 2021.
