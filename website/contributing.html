      <p>I’d love your help to make <em>Library Map</em> as accurate and useful as possible.</p>

      <ol type="1">
      <li>You can <a href="https://github.com/hughrun/public_library_map/issues">create an issue</a> on GitHub.</li>
      <li>You can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">send a pull request</a> — though it is <em>strongly preferred</em> that you either ask to be assigned to an existing issue, or create a new issue, first.</li>
      <li>You can just send an email to <code>librarymap</code>@<code>hugh</code>.<code>run</code></li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="missing-or-inaccurate-data">Missing or inaccurate data</h3>
      <p>Currently we’re missing data for some library services in relation to <strong>standard loan periods</strong> and <strong>fines for overdue items</strong>.</p>
      <p>It’s likely that some <strong>library location data</strong> is inaccurate — especially for New South Wales. It’s also possible that the address data is wrong (even though the location shown may be correct), and in some cases it is missing.</p>
      <p>It’s possible that some of the <strong>fines data for Queensland</strong> is a little off. This came from the State Library of Queensland but I know for a fact that some of the data was wrong (e.g. Gold Coast Libraries does not charge overdue fines, but the SLQ reports says it does).</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested if you know of data sources for entire regions, states, or Australia — especially if they’re reliably kept up to date.</p>
      <h3 id="ideas-for-additional-data">Ideas for additional data</h3>
      <p>You might have an idea for library data that would be useful to map. I’m really happy to hear about these ideas! It’s possible that the information you want to map is unavailable, or just really hard to get, or maybe I will disagree that it’s useful. That’s ok - please ask anyway, expecially if you know where to find the data.</p>
      <h3 id="improvements-to-documentation">Improvements to documentation</h3>
      <p>I’m always — <em>always</em> — happy to hear how I can improve documentation. Even better if you make the edit and then send a pull request.</p>
      <h3 id="improvements-to-the-website-design-layout-or-information">Improvements to the website design, layout, or information</h3>
      <p>You might have an idea for an improvement that’s not about the data per se, but rather about the website. Maybe there’s some accessibilty improvements I can make. Let me know!</p>
